5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any? 

I thought this assignment was very difficult because I am not familiar
with any of this stuff apart from basic html and DNS so having no
office hours and piazza being not that helpful, I had to look up every
step and had so many issues and roadblocks that were unnecessary. I
believe that we should have at least gone over some of this in class
because I'm not here to look things up and learn I'm here to be taught
how to do this stuff. If I wanted to scour the internet and youtube
for hours on end only to come across multiple dead ends I wouldn't
have signed up for this course. I'm very disappointed in a class that
I was looking forward to learning more in. The main aspects I
struggled with were setting up the virtual box/linux, the SSH key
pairs, and hosting the html files to the servers.
